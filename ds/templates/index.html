							<h1>The Problem</h1>

						<div class="problem-text">
							<p>There is little to no effort locally and across Africa to educate the public about congenital disorders. As a result, some families and individuals fall short to stereotypes and beliefs about the causes of some of these conditions. CURE Hospital, Uganda, a donor funded hospital in Uganda which specializes in neurosurgery and specifically hydrocephalus and spina bifida has some really shocking findings. In some villages in Uganda, families KILL their own children! Children who are born with Hydrocephalus and Spina Bifida are most often considered cursed or affected by witchcraft. There are cases where these children are abandoned or neglected and left to die in their homes. Eventually, these children succumb to the effects of non treatment and are secretly buried and forgotten about. In extreme cases, the women accompanied by their kin drown their own children in nearby rivers! Who in this case will fight for these children? Don't they DESERVE to live they life they have a chance of living?</p>
